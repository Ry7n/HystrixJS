Proposals are a great way to get design feedback before you spend your time implementing a solution.

Describe your proposal at a high level. Include:

* What you're trying to solve
* Why you it's important
* What changes you'd make
* Any trade-offs or compromises this proposal makes

If your proposal resolves and open issue, link to it.
